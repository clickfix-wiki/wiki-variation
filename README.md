# ClickFix Techniques
A comprehensive database of social engineering pretenses and Indicators of ClickFix (IoCF) to help identify and prevent social engineering attacks.

## What is ClickFix?

ClickFix refers to social engineering techniques where scammers trick victims into pasting malicious scripts, commands, or files into their systems through various pretexts. This can lead to system compromise, data theft, and financial loss.

## Features

- **Searchable Database**: Find techniques by title, description, or IoCFs
- **Tag-based Filtering**: Filter by OS, capabilities, and other categories
- **Comprehensive IoCFs**: Each technique includes detailed indicators of compromise
- **Difficulty Ratings**: Techniques are categorized by difficulty level
- **Prevention Tips**: Each technique includes prevention strategies
- **GitHub Pages Compatible**: Simple HTML/CSS/JS implementation

**Note**: Individual technique pages (`pages/` directory) are generated automatically during the build process and are not committed to the repository.

## YAML File Format

Each technique is stored in its own YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
id: unique-technique-id
title: Technique Name

## Deployment

This website is designed to work with GitHub Pages. Simply:

1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. The site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

## Contributing

To add new techniques:

1. Run `node add-technique.js` to create a new technique interactively
2. Or manually create a new YAML file in the `techniques/` directory
3. Follow the established format
4. Submit a pull request

The HTML pages will be generated automatically during the GitHub Actions build process.

### Available Scripts
